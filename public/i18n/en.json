  "about-us": {
    "p0": "We are Andreas and Stefanos, two people from Greece living and working in Denmark. Our roots go back to two small coastal villages — Gytheio and Aidipsos. We grew up by the sea, with the sun always above us and meals that were both delicious and, as we later realized, incredibly healthy. A big factor to both of these was olive oil; a delicacy which was always present at our table — either from our own family farm or from a neighbor’s — and back then, we didn’t think twice about it. It was just a part of life.",
    "p1": "It wasn’t until we moved to Denmark that we realized what we’d grown up with wasn’t so easy to find. The flavors we took for granted — good olive oil, feta and other products that were in abundance at home — were missing from Danish shelves. We wanted to share a little bit of what we had back home with people who care about what they eat. That’s why we created Mediterranean Boutique.",
    "p2": "Our mission is simple: to bring a little bit of our home to Denmark. But we want to do it the right way — the way we've learned here in Denmark: the Danish way. We work with producers who care for the environment and follow sustainable, organic practices, bringing only the best the Mediterranean has to offer."
