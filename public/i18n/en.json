  "about-us": {
    "p0": "Mediterranean Boutique is a company started by two young people living in Denmark, but with deep roots in the Mediterranean. Both of us grew up in small villages in Greece, surrounded by family traditions, pure flavors, and a deep respect for quality. We know how special those products are - and how hard they are to find outside their homeland.",
    "p1": "After living in Copenhagen for several years, the idea took root: What if we could share the taste, quality, and values we grew up with - with people who truly appreciate the difference?",
    "p2": "That’s how Mediterranean Boutique was born.",
    "p3": "We’re passionate about sourcing only the finest products, handpicked from producers who  care deeply about their craft. We speak to them directly, review their processes, check  every certification, and choose only what we believe in - no compromises.",
    "p4": "This isn’t about mass production. It’s about meaningful selection. And as we grow, our goal stays the same: to connect people with real Mediterranean products, full of tradition, flavor, and heart."
